TODO:
 - more strict encapsulation in modules
 - refactoring

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
 - Input handler: WASD opens FF quick search bar -> set focus to some textfield, while game is on, to prevent this

CORRECTED PROBLEMS:
 ++ Input handler: restrict one user input per server tick (latest will be used when ticked)
 ++ Chat: prevent unauthorized user chat
